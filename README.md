Uni Shopping JSON REST API App

Shpotastic: My Final Major Project for my university project. 

Created on Android Studio using Kotlin, Retrofit, Coroutines and ViewBinding.

Features:
- Fetches Data from an API
- Has a password login page (here are the accounts: username/password for admin access | milan/password to see the checkout page)
- Male and Female section clothing 
- Top and bottom navigation bar
- Threaded to ensure the add doesn't crash (using coroutines)
